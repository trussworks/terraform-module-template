# Truss Terraform Module template

This repository is meant to be a template repo we can just spin up new module repos from with our general format.

## Creating a new Terraform Module

1. Clone this repo, renaming appropriately.
1. Write your terraform code in the root dir.
1. Create an example of the module in use in the `examples` dir.
1. Ensure you've completed the [Developer Setup](#developer-setup).
1. Write terratests in the `test` dir.
1. [With slight modification from the Terratest docs](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest#setting-up-your-project): In the root dir, run `go mod init MODULE_NAME` to get a new go.mod file. Then run `go mod tidy` to download terratest.
1. Run your tests to ensure they work as expected using instructions below.
